    <h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Welcome to Fortress Facility Solutions</p>
<p>Based in the heart of Summit County, CO, Fortress Facility Solutions is your trusted one-stop shop for commercial property care. We know the unique challenges of operating in the high country, and we’ve built our business around providing fast, dependable, and efficient solutions that keep your facilities running strong year-round.</p>
<p>Our story begins in the property management and rental management world, where we spent years coordinating multiple vendors and contractors. Managing timelines, costs, and quality across different providers was a full-time project management job in itself. We asked ourselves: what if we could bring it all under one roof? Fortress Facility Solutions was born—designed to simplify property care, control quality, and keep costs predictable for our clients.</p>
<p>From landscaping and janitorial services to carpet & floor care, snow & ice management, handyman work, and light construction, we bring every essential service together under one roof. Our goal is simple: to take the stress out of facility management so you can focus on growing your business.</p>
<p>At Fortress, we pride ourselves on being more than just a vendor—we’re a partner. Our local team understands the importance of safe, clean, and welcoming spaces for offices, HOAs, hotels, retail centers, and beyond. By combining professional expertise with personalized care, we deliver solutions tailored to your property’s needs, ensuring both aesthetics and functionality support long-term success.</p>
